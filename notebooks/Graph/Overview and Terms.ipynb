    "- Graphs are a more general structure than trees we can think of a tree as a special kind of graph. \n",
    "- Graphs can be used to represent many real-world things such as systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, etc.\n",
    "- Once we have a good representation for a problem, we can use some standard graph algorithms to solve what otherwise might seem to be a very difficult problem.\n",
    "- Computers can operate well with information presented as a graph.\n",
