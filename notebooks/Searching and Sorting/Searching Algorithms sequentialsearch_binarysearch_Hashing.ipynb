    ">- One way to deal with clustering is to skip slots, thereby more evenly distributing the items that have caused collisions. \n",
    "> - The general name for this process of looking for another slot after a collision is **rehashing**. \n",
    "> - A variation of the linear probing idea is called **quadratic probing**. \n",
