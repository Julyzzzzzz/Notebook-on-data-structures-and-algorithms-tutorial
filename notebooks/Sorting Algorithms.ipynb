    "- The quick sort uses divide and conquer to **gain the same advantages as the merge sort**, **while not using additional storage**. \n",
    "- As a trade-off, however, *it is possible that the list may not be divided in half*. When this happens, we will see that performance is diminished.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A quick sort first selects a value, which is called the **pivot value**. \n",
    "- The role of the pivot value is **to assist with splitting the list**. \n",
    "- The actual position where the pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, commonly called the split point, will be used to divide the list for subsequent calls to the quick sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After finding the pivot point, the **partition process** will happen next. \n",
    "- It will find the **split point** and at the same time move other items to the appropriate side of the list, either less than or greater than the pivot value. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partition process  \n",
    "- **leftmark, stop when > pivot value; right mark, stop when < pivot value**\n",
    "- If the number (2nd index) is smaller than pivot point(assume taking the 1st element 54 as pivot point), move to the next index number 3rd, until can't move(find the position where the next number is greater than the pivot value); on the right side starting with the last element, if smaller than 54, stop, if greater, move to the previous index. when leftmark and right mark both stop, swap them. Then continue moving the leftmark and rightmark (if 3rd and 10th swapped, continue moving from 4th and 9th). when leftmark is at 6th and rightmark is at 7th, swap, then rightmark < rightmark. Split point found, exchange rightmark(smaller element) with the pivot value. Now we have the smallest number found and sorted at the right position."
